As a group, we were interested in seeing if there was a correlation between two datasets: poverty, and rent rates. From making direct comparisons with the two datasets, we have identified that there is indeed a possible inverse correlation between the two variables. **The relationship being, as poverty levels increase the average costs of renting a home/property decrease.**

Below are four examples that support this claim:
- **Washington State**: In *2013*, the estimated poverty rate was *14.1* percent for the entire state, while the average rent at the end of that year was *$1320*. Then, in *2016*, when the estimated poverty rate was *11.3* percent, the average year end rent was *$1611*.

- **New York**: In *2011*, the estimated poverty rate was *16.1* percent for the entire state, while the average rent at the end of that year was *$1710*. Then, in *2016*, when the estimated poverty rate was *14.8* percent, the average year end rent was *$2273*.

- **California**: In *2012*, the estimated poverty rate was *17* percent for the entire state, while the average rent at the end of that year was *$1781*. Then, in *2016*, when the estimated poverty rate was *14.1* percent, the average year end rent was *$2337*.

- **Texas**: In *2011*, the estimated poverty rate was *18.5* percent for the entire state, while the average rent at the end of that year was *$1027*. Then, in *2016*, when the estimated poverty rate was *15.6* percent, the average year end rent was *$1298*.

As you can see from the information regarding these particular states, as poverty levels increase, rent decreases.

*Note: One important factor to consider for judging the validity of this claim is the size of the pool of data that we used. Because the Zillow rent dataset was very limited regarding date ranges and the poverty dataset only included data from 1980 to 2016, it is important to acknowledge that the assumptions only represent trends within a period of around 6 years (late 2010 to 2016).*
