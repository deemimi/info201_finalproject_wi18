<b><h1><center>Hello and welcome to our INFO 201 final project!</center></h1></b>
<center>For our final project in the class, our team was tasked with building some sort of interactive platform using R software to analyze a big set of data.</center>
<h3>So what did we choose to do?</h3>
<blockquote>Our team decided to create a Shiny app as our interactive platform because it's a create way to impart information to viewer's as well as being super user friendly.
The next step for us was to decide what dataset(s) to really take a look at.
We wanted to explore data that had meaning to us and that we thought was relevant to what's currently going on.</blockquote>

<h3>Poverty </h3>
<blockquote>The first dataset we will be examining is on poverty levels in the United States.
Poverty is something that affects hundreds of thousands of people across the United States yearly and is a serious issue in society even today; UNICEF reported in 2013 that the United States has <i>the second highest child poverty rates of all developed countries</i>.
Our data was sourced from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Poverty-Statistics.html">The United States Census Bureau API</a>.
More specifically, the <b>Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates</b> (SAIPE) which provides information on the total number of people in poverty per state for the years 1989-2016.
With this, we can compare both poverty levels between states, as well as between years.</blockquote>

<h3>Rent </h3>
<blockquote>The second dataset we will be examining is on rent rates in the United States.
In Seattle especially rent rates are going through the roof, and we were interested in seeing if there would be any statistical or visual correlation between the level of poverty and average rent level in a state.
Our data was sourced from <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/">Zillow Research</a> where we downloaded a .csv file of their rental values.
The data was in the form of <b>Zillow Rent Index</b> (ZRI), which is defined as a "smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated market rate rent across a given region and housing type."
It gives us the median rent amounts per month per state from the years 2010-2018 (87 months total, with some missing).</blockquote>

<center><h5>The purpose of our project is to use the above datasets to analyze and determine the relationship (if any) between poverty levels and median rent rates - comparing different states as well as different years.</h5></center>
